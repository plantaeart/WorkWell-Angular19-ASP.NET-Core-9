# Work Well ðŸ™‚

## My new project in Angular 19 / ASP.NET Core 9 webapi / Firestore (from Google Firebase) ðŸŽ‰

I will create an app to help people to make pauses when they work. The solution of this problem is : Work Well !
A tool that will run in background on your browser and will tell you where you are in your day :
* If you have a planned meeting (like a daily meeting)
* When you need to go eat your lunch
* Or when you need to take a brake from your hard core computer session !

## The Stack ðŸ˜Ž

### FrontEnd
I will use Angular 19 with NGrX for state management

### BackEnd
I will use ASP.NET Core 9 web API with the unkown Firestore (never use it before, it's an NOSQL SAAS service, so we will check that). I will also use Swagger to have a clean API's controllers.

## Run the Backend ðŸš€
* Open VS Code
* Get the project from my repo
* Install this C# kit from Microsoft : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit
* In the terminal run : dotnet run
* Go to the URL : __http://localhost:5213/swagger__ to get the API specifications

 ## Notes from me ðŸ’­
 * 21/04/2025 : It's been a while since i used some C# (that i love ! Except the fact that you always need to connect with your microsof account to use the APS.NET universe...). And also will be the first time i will use Firestore. Will tell you if it's easy to use and put in place.
